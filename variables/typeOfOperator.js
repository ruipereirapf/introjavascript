/* Exercise
Use console.log() to print the typeof newVariable.
Now let’s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1.
Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.

// Use console.log() to print the typeof newVariable.
console.log(typeof newVariable);

// Now let’s check what happens if we reassign the variable. Below the console.log() statement, reassign newVariable to 1.

// Since you assigned this new value to newVariable, it has a new type! On the line below your reassignment, use console.log() to print typeof newVariable again.
