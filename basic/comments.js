/* Exercise:
Write a single line comment that says Opening line.
Single line comments are great for adding context to your code.
Multi-line comments are often best suited to prevent a block of code from running.
However, both types of comments can be used for either purpose.

Use a multi-line comment to comment out the rest of the code after the first console.log line. Only It was love at first sight. should be logged to the console.
*/

// Opening line
console.log('It was love at first sight.');

/*console.log('The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.');
console.log('Yossarian was in the hospital with a pain in his liver that fell just short of being jaundice.');
console.log('The doctors were puzzled by the fact that it wasn\'t quite jaundice.');
console.log('If it became jaundice they could treat it.');
console.log('If it didn\'t become jaundice and went away they could discharge him.');
console.log('But this just being short of jaundice all the time confused them.');*/
