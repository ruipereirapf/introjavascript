/*Exercise:
Inside a console.log() statement, concatenate the two strings 'Hello' and 'World'.
We left off the space last time. Create a second console.log() statement in which you concatenate the strings 'Hello' and 'World', but this time make sure to also include a space (' ') between the two words.
